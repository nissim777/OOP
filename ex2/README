SpaceShip - The abstract base_class for all space ships

HumanShip - An implementation of human-controlled ship
FollowerShip - A base_class for follower ships, which are ships that try to follow other ships
AgressiveShip - An implementation of an agressive ship which pursues other ships and tries to fire at them

Design

=============================

I choosed to use SpaceShip as my base abstract class, since all the ships have lot of basic common values and
functions, and the realtions defined are that a specific spaceship is "is a" kind of spaceship so it's more 
suitable here to use Abstract class and not interface, which is "has a". 
The SpaceShip class is only abstract because of one abstract method of image, which every ship must implement.

Also, I saw that there is a common beheaviour and functionality to wide amount of spaceships, that they try to 
get closer to the nearst ship in order to make their abilities so i created another super class who is the
super class of SpaceShip and the Aggresive, Busher, Special and Drunkard. 

I thought at the beginning that I should use here interface because its some ability of this ships 
but I wanted to implement the code of following so I choosed just class, in order to avoid code repeation. 

=============================

Implementation details
=
=============================

the main class SpaceWars, who is not included, launching the game and deals also with all the phisics and graphic
details, some of them by invoking the suitable classes in package and some of them by checking the phisics state. 

The Factory Class is in charge of creating the instances of the ship in the beginning of the game. 

The main base class for ALL the ships is the spaceships is SpaceShip, and it also managing the implemention of 
the common functions made by ships, as activating shield or shooting. This is an abstract class, because it also 
has an abstract method, as detailed before. 
This class inherits to: Runner, Follower 

Follower is a class who implements the function of "chasing" other ships, and although it is not managing a ship 
he is not abstract because he implements the abstract method of the super class. 
This class inherits to: Aggresive, Basher, Specail and Drunkard. 

=============================
= SpecialShip =
=============================

 The special Ship is kind of LEECH SHIP, which drains energy from the closest ship by forcing it to 
 activate its shield and stoping its energy regeneration. 

 If the energy draining continues over 300 ticks after its reached to zero, the special
 ship becames some kind of a leech and activating its parasite ability, killing the other ship slowly
 and converts each life point it has into 2 life points for itself. 

 The special ship has special cool green look, and when he activates his parasite ability he suddenly
 "jumps" on the poor victim ship and paralises him. 

=============================
= DrunkardShip =
=============================

  The drankardShip moves like crazy in rapid speed all over the screen. that's is't clear to 
  anyone where and why, but the only thing that is sure that you better kill him as soon as possible,
  because every round there is a chance of 1:100 for appearnce of an powerfull invisble Ally, 
  which cannot be seen and just shots everyone. 
  
  The invisble Ally is INDESTRUCTABLE and the only way to kill him is by killing the DrunkardShip itself. 
  The problem is.. that every shot of the Invisble Ally towards the DrunkardShip increases his life in 2 points.
  so.. from the minute that the invisble Ally appears (or not..) the game becomes very hard.
